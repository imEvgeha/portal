# Folder Structure 

Each component will have one folder
The folder will include:
- \<component\>.tsx that will export the component and its sub components
- \<component\>.constants.ts - if needed
- a folder for each sub-component
- Each component/sub-component will have its \<component\>.styled.js file - Styled Components, and \<component\>.test.tsx - test file


Split the components in folders based on their type:
- general - modal, status tag
- layout - header, subheader, grid
- interaction- buttons, tab
- modules - page layout
