# Rules
- **Less is more!**
- Follow [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) and [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)
- Write small components that do one thing and do it well

# Commit rules
- Each commit message header should follow this regex `^PORT-\d+: \S.*` i.e. start with the JIRA ticket
- The commit message header should be short and descriptive
- Further details can be added in the commit message body

# Pull Request Process
- Ensure that the tests pass **before** creating the PR
- Each PR needs at least two approvals before it can be merged to master
